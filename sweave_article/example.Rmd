title: A Simple Example for rnw_to_rmd Function
abstract: |
  Many of the early R packages used Sweave to write vigneettes, which
  will be shown to users as pdf format on CRAN. However, as time goes
  on, R Markdown, a lightweight markup language, has begun to gradually
  replace Sweave and better present content on CRAN in the form of HTML.

  In order to help many R package developers who haven't used R Markdown
  or don't have time to do the format conversion manually to migrate
  from Sweave to R Markdown, `texor` helps people automate this
  conversion process.

# Introduction to Sweave and Knitr

Sweave options will be automatically converted to knitr.

``` {r include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(
tidy=FALSE
)
```

To remove warning messages, setup code chunk use knitr option
`warning=FALSE`.

``` {r setup,include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
```

When the option OutDec is not `.`, put numbers in `\text`.

``` {r }
options(OutDec = ',')
```

This is the first test. abc `r 0.6` def

another test $a = `r 0.6`$.

and the last one $a = `r '0.6'`$.

``` {r }
options(OutDec = '.')
```

This is the second test. abc `r 0.6` def

another test $a = `r 0.6`$.

and the last one $a = `r '0.6'`$.

Inline R code in verbatim environment will also be converted.

``` r
try this:
`r 1+1`
```

# Generate Image from R Code Chunk

The first image:

``` {r test, fig.cap="A fig o cars"}
# Define the cars vector with 5 values
cars <- c(1, 3, 6, 4, 9)
plot(cars, type="o", col="blue")
title(main="Autos", col.main="red", font.main=4)
```

Insert a reference to the first image: [[fig:test]](#fig:test). And for
bibtex[@Yinxiang:2024].

Let's test another image from R code chunk:

``` {r image, fig.cap="matrix package's image"}
library(Matrix)
data(CAex, package = "Matrix")
print(image(CAex, main = "image(CAex)")) # print(.) needed for Sweave
```

Show R logo from file:

![Figure 1: R logo](Rlogo.png){width="50.0%"
alt="graphic without alt text"}
