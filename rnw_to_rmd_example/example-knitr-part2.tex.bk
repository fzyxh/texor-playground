\begin{abstract}
  Many statistics methods require one or more least squares problems
  to be solved.  There are several ways to perform this calculation,
  using objects from the base R system and using objects in the
  classes defined in the \code{Matrix} package.

  We compare the speed of some of these methods on a very small
  example and on a example for which the model matrix is large and
  sparse.

Sweave options will be automatically converted to knitr.

To remove warning messages, setup code chunk use knitr option \texttt{warning=FALSE}.

When the option OutDec is not \texttt{.}, put numbers in \texttt{\textbackslash{}text}. See \#348.

This is the first test. abc \Sexpr{0.6} def

another test $a = \Sexpr{0.6}$.

and the last one $a = \Sexpr{'0.6'}$.
